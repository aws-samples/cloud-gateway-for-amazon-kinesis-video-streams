# AuthenticationFlow Test Progress

## ✅ Completed
- **Minimized test output** - Configured vitest with `--reporter=basic` and `--no-coverage` to reduce Amazon Q quota usage
- **Fixed test configuration** - Updated package.json and vitest.config.ts for minimal output
- **Identified component issues** - Tests are correctly failing, revealing real implementation gaps

## 🔍 Current Test Status
- **5 tests passing** ✅
- **3 tests failing** ❌ (correctly identifying real issues)

### Failing Tests (Real Issues to Fix)
1. **Form Submission**: `mockSignIn` not being called - mock setup needs investigation
2. **Error Handling**: "Invalid credentials" text not found - error display not working
3. **Loading States**: Inputs not disabled during loading - loading state implementation issue

## 📝 Test Configuration Changes
- `package.json`: Added `--reporter=basic --no-coverage` to test scripts
- `vitest.config.ts`: Set default reporter to 'basic' and disabled coverage
- Tests now produce minimal output while maintaining full functionality

## 🎯 Next Steps
- Fix component implementation to match test expectations
- Investigate mock setup for form submission
- Ensure error messages are properly displayed
- Verify loading state disables inputs correctly

## 💡 Key Insight
The test failures are **good** - they're revealing real gaps in component implementation that need to be addressed. The testing infrastructure is working correctly.
