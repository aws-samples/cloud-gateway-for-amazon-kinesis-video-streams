# üéØ Enhanced GStreamer Expert - Q CLI Usage Guide

## üöÄ Getting Started

Start Q CLI and begin asking GStreamer questions:
```bash
q chat
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Available Tools

### 1. **Comprehensive GStreamer Expert**
Ask any GStreamer question for complete solutions:
```
How do I create an RTSP to KVS pipeline with audio and video?
Help me optimize my pipeline for low latency streaming
I need to add object detection to my webcam pipeline
```

### 2. **Element Search**
Find specific GStreamer elements:
```
Search for NVIDIA H.264 encoders
Find elements for audio conversion
What elements can I use for RTSP streaming?
```

### 3. **Element Documentation**
Get detailed information about specific elements:
```
Get documentation for kvssink
Show me properties of x264enc
What caps does rtspsrc support?
```

### 4. **Pipeline Patterns**
Find working pipeline examples:
```
Find RTSP to KVS pipeline patterns
Show me webcam recording examples
Search for multi-output tee patterns
```

### 5. **Troubleshooting**
Diagnose pipeline issues:
```
My pipeline has pixelation issues: gst-launch-1.0 rtspsrc ! rtph264depay ! h264parse ! x264enc bitrate=100 ! kvssink
Troubleshoot green screen artifacts in my RTSP pipeline
My pipeline uses too much CPU, how can I optimize it?
```

## üéØ Example Conversations

### Knowledge Base Integration
All responses are backed by:
- 324 comprehensive GStreamer documents
- Tested pipeline examples
- Platform-specific optimizations
- Hardware acceleration guides

## üéØ Tips for Best Results

1. **Be Specific**: Include pipeline commands, error messages, or specific requirements
2. **Mention Platform**: Specify macOS, Linux, or Windows for optimized recommendations
3. **Describe Issues**: Use specific terms like "pixelation", "green screen", "high CPU"
4. **Ask Follow-ups**: The system maintains context for iterative improvements

## üö® Troubleshooting Q CLI Integration

If tools aren't working:
1. Check MCP server status: Look for "enhanced-gstreamer-expert" in available tools
2. Restart Q CLI session: Exit and run `q chat` again
3. Check server logs: Look for any startup errors
4. Verify configuration: Ensure MCP configuration is correct

## üìä Quality Assurance

The system includes automated testing for:
- Pipeline accuracy validation
- Element compatibility checking
- Quality issue diagnosis
- Performance optimization recommendations

All responses are continuously validated against real-world scenarios.
