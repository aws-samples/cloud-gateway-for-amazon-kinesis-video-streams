# Color space issue resolution
gst-launch-1.0 rtspsrc ! rtph264depay ! h264parse ! avdec_h264 ! \
  videoconvert ! video/x-raw,format=I420 ! autovideosink
```

### **Accurate KVS Feature Support**
```bash
# H.265 + AAC for HLS/DASH (now correctly documented as supported)
gst-launch-1.0 rtspsrc name=src \
  src. ! rtph265depay ! h265parse ! kvssink name=sink \
  src. ! rtpmp4adepay ! aacparse ! sink.
```
