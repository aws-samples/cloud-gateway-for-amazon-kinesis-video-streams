###### Running the `gst-launch-1.0` command to start streaming from a RTSP camera source.
```
$ gst-launch-1.0 -v rtspsrc location=rtsp://YourCameraRtspUrl short-header=TRUE ! rtph264depay ! h264parse ! kvssink stream-name=YourStreamName storage-size=128
```

**Note:** If you are using **IoT credentials** then you can pass them as parameters to the gst-launch-1.0 command
```
$ gst-launch-1.0 -v rtspsrc location="rtsp://YourCameraRtspUrl" short-header=TRUE ! rtph264depay ! h264parse ! kvssink stream-name="iot-stream" iot-certificate="iot-certificate,endpoint=endpoint,cert-path=/path/to/certificate,key-path=/path/to/private/key,ca-path=/path/to/ca-cert,role-aliases=role-aliases"
```
You can find the RTSP URL from your IP camera manual or manufacturers product page.

###### Running the `gst-launch-1.0` command to start streaming from USB camera source which has h264 encoded stream already:
```
$ gst-launch-1.0 -v v4l2src device=/dev/video0 ! h264parse ! video/x-h264,stream-format=avc,alignment=au ! kvssink stream-name=YourStreamName storage-size=128 access-key="YourAccessKey" secret-key="YourSecretKey"
```

###### Running the `gst-launch-1.0` command to start streaming from camera source:

```
$ gst-launch-1.0 -v v4l2src do-timestamp=TRUE device=/dev/video0 ! videoconvert ! video/x-raw,format=I420,width=640,height=480,framerate=30/1 ! omxh264enc periodicty-idr=45 inline-header=FALSE ! h264parse ! video/x-h264,stream-format=avc,alignment=au ! kvssink stream-name=YourStreamName access-key="YourAccessKey" secret-key="YourSecretKey"
```
or use a different encoder
```
$ gst-launch-1.0 -v v4l2src device=/dev/video0 ! videoconvert ! video/x-raw,format=I420,width=640,height=480,framerate=30/1 ! x264enc  bframes=0 key-int-max=45 bitrate=500 tune=zerolatency ! video/x-h264,stream-format=avc,alignment=au ! kvssink stream-name=YourStreamName storage-size=128 access-key="YourAccessKey" secret-key="YourSecretKey"
```

**Note:** If you are using **Raspberry PI with Bullseye** you have to use another encoder as well as `libcamerasrc` instead of `v4l2src device=/dev/video0`

##### Running the `gst-launch-1.0` command with Iot-certificate and different stream-names than the thing-name

**Note:** Supply a the matching iot-thing-name (that the certificate points to) and we can stream to multiple stream-names (without the stream-name needing to be the same as the thing-name) using the same certificate credentials. iot-thing-name and stream-name can be completely different as long as there is a policy that allows the thing to write to the kinesis stream
```
$ gst-launch-1.0 -v rtspsrc location="rtsp://YourCameraRtspUrl" short-header=TRUE ! rtph264depay ! video/x-h264, format=avc,alignment=au !
 h264parse ! kvssink name=aname storage-size=512 iot-certificate="iot-certificate,endpoint=xxxxx.credentials.iot.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com,cert-path=/greengrass/v2/thingCert.crt,key-path=/greengrass/v2/privKey.key,ca-path=/greengrass/v2/rootCA.pem,role-aliases=KvsCameraIoTRoleAlias,iot-thing-name=myThingName123" aws-region="ap-southeast-2" log-config="/etc/mtdata/kvssink-log.config" stream-name=myThingName123-video1

##### Running the GStreamer sample application to upload a *audio and video* file

`kinesis_video_gstreamer_audio_video_sample_app` supports uploading a video that is either MKV, MPEGTS, or MP4. The sample application expects the video is encoded in H264 and audio is encoded in AAC format. Note: If your media uses a different format, then you can revise the pipeline elements in the sample application to suit your media format.

Change your current working directory to `build`. Launch the sample application with a stream name and a path to the file and it will start streaming.

```
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=YourAccessKeyId AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=YourSecretAccessKey ./kvs_gstreamer_audio_video_sample <my-stream> </path/to/file>
```

##### Running the GStreamer sample application to stream audio and video from live source

`kvs_gstreamer_audio_video_sample` supports streaming audio and video from live sources such as a audio enabled webcam. First you need to figure out what your audio device is using the steps mentioned above and export it as environment variable like such:

`export AWS_KVS_AUDIO_DEVICE=hw:1,0`

You can also choose to use other video devices by doing
