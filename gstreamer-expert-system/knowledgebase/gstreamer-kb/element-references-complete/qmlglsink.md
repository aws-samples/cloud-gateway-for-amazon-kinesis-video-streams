# Todo

For-later pages:
 - tutorials/qt-tutorials.md [tpm: this should all be rewritten from scratch with qmlglsink; QtGStreamer is outdated and unmaintained, we should not promote it]
   - basic-media-player.md
   - qt-gstreamer-vs-c-gstreamer.md
   - using-appsink-appsrc-in-qt.md

Miscellaneous:
 - faq/git.md should be renamed building.md and turned into general
   building Q+A or (better) point to a page we have for all that by then
 - faq/legal.md needs an overhaul, and be made more relevant
 - licensing.md and legal-information.md need to be reviewed + merged,
   possibly with FAQ section.

old sitemap:

            Installing on Linux
