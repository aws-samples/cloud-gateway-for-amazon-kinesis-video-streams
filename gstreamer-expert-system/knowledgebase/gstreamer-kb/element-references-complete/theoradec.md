as required or as queue elements are inserted in the pipeline) and bins
(using brackets, so “(” and “)”). You can use dots to imply padnames on
elements, or even omit the padname to automatically select a pad. Using
all this, the pipeline `gst-launch filesrc location=file.ogg ! oggdemux
name=d
d. ! queue ! theoradec ! videoconvert ! xvimagesink
d. ! queue ! vorbisdec ! audioconvert ! audioresample ! alsasink
` will play an Ogg file containing a Theora video-stream and a Vorbis
audio-stream. You can also use autopluggers such as decodebin on the
commandline. See the manual page of `gst-launch` for more information.

### `gst-inspect`

`gst-inspect` can be used to inspect all properties, signals, dynamic
parameters and the object hierarchy of an element. This can be very
useful to see which `GObject` properties or which signals (and using
what arguments) an element supports. Run `gst-inspect fakesrc` to get an
idea of what it does. See the manual page of `gst-inspect` for more
information.
