    e.g. "src%d" to "src%u" or "src\_%u" or similar, since we don't want
    to see negative numbers in pad names. This mostly affects
    applications that create request pads from elements.

  - some elements that used to have a single dynamic source pad have a
    source pad now. Example: wavparse, id3demux, iceydemux, apedemux.
    (This does not affect applications using decodebin or playbin).

  - playbin now proxies the GstVideoOverlay (former GstXOverlay)
    interface, so most applications can just remove the sync bus handler
    where they would set the window ID, and instead just set the window
    ID on playbin from the application thread before starting playback.

    playbin also proxies the GstColorBalance and GstNavigation
    interfaces, so applications that use this don't need to go fishing
    for elements that may implement those any more, but can just use on
    playbin unconditionally.

  - multifdsink, tcpclientsink, tcpclientsrc, tcpserversrc the protocol
    property is removed, use gdppay and gdpdepay.


## Use Cases

  - mp3 with id3- and apetags

  - plug id3demux \! apedemux

  - avi with vorbis audio

  - plug avidemux

  - new pad â†’ audio/vorbis

  - plug vorbisdec or special vorbiscomment reader

## Additional Thoughts

  - would it make sense to have 2-phase tag-reading (property on tagbin
    and/or tagread elements)

  - 1st phase: get tag-data that are directly embedded in the data
    <functional>[/<media type>]*[/<extra...>]*
```

### Examples:

    apedemux         : Extracter/Metadata
    audiotestsrc     : Source/Audio
    autoaudiosink    : Sink/Audio/Device
    cairotimeoverlay : Mixer/Video/Text
    dvdec            : Decoder/Video
    dvdemux          : Demuxer
    goom             : Converter/Audio/Video
    id3demux         : Extracter/Metadata
    udpsrc           : Source/Network/Protocol/Device
    videomixer       : Mixer/Video
    videoconvert     : Filter/Video             (intended use to convert video with as little
                                                 visible change as possible)
    vertigotv        : Effect/Video             (intended use is to change the video)
    volume           : Effect/Audio             (intended use is to change the audio data)
    vorbisdec        : Decoder/Audio
    vorbisenc        : Encoder/Audio
If your element is exclusively loop-based, you may or may not want a
sink event function (since the element is driving the pipeline it will
know the length of the stream in advance or be notified by the flow
return value of `gst_pad_pull_range()`. In some cases even loop-based
elements may receive events from upstream though (for example audio
decoders with an id3demux or apedemux element in front of them, or
demuxers that are being fed input from sources that send additional
information about the stream in custom events, as DVD sources do).

## Upstream events

Upstream events are generated by an element somewhere downstream in the
pipeline (example: a video sink may generate navigation events that
inform upstream elements about the current position of the mouse
pointer). This may also happen indirectly on request of the application,
for example when the application executes a seek on a pipeline this seek
request will be passed on to a sink element which will then in turn
generate an upstream seek event.

The most common upstream events are seek events, Quality-of-Service
(QoS) and reconfigure events.
    e.g. "src%d" to "src%u" or "src\_%u" or similar, since we don't want
    to see negative numbers in pad names. This mostly affects
    applications that create request pads from elements.

  - some elements that used to have a single dynamic source pad have a
    source pad now. Example: wavparse, id3demux, iceydemux, apedemux.
    (This does not affect applications using decodebin or playbin).

  - playbin now proxies the GstVideoOverlay (former GstXOverlay)
    interface, so most applications can just remove the sync bus handler
