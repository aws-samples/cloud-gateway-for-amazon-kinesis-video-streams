## GNOME desktop

GStreamer has been the media backend of the
[GNOME](http://www.gnome.org/) desktop since GNOME-2.2 onwards.
Nowadays, a whole bunch of GNOME applications make use of GStreamer for
media-processing, including (but not limited to)
[Rhythmbox](http://www.rhythmbox.org/),
[Videos](https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Videos) and [Sound
Juicer](https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/SoundJuicer).
