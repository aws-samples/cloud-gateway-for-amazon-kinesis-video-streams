  - For audio input and output, GStreamer provides input and output
    elements for several audio subsystems. Amongst others, GStreamer
    includes elements for ALSA (alsasrc, alsasink), OSS (osssrc,
    osssink) Pulesaudio (pulsesrc, pulsesink) and Sun audio
    (sunaudiosrc, sunaudiomixer, sunaudiosink).

  - For video input, GStreamer contains source elements for Video4linux2
    (v4l2src, v4l2element, v4l2sink).

  - For video output, GStreamer provides elements for output to
    X-windows (ximagesink), Xv-windows (xvimagesink; for
    hardware-accelerated video), direct-framebuffer (dfbimagesink) and
    openGL image contexts (glsink).

## GNOME desktop

GStreamer has been the media backend of the
[GNOME](http://www.gnome.org/) desktop since GNOME-2.2 onwards.
Nowadays, a whole bunch of GNOME applications make use of GStreamer for
media-processing, including (but not limited to)
