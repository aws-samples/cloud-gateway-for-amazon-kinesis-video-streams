# Sparse Streams

## Introduction

In 0.8, there was some support for sparse streams through the use of
`FILLER` events. These were used to mark gaps between buffers so that
downstream elements could know not to expect any more data for that gap.

In 0.10, segment information conveyed through `SEGMENT` events can be used
for the same purpose.

In 1.0, there is a `GAP` event that works in a similar fashion as the
`FILLER` event in 0.8.

## Use cases

### Sub-title streams

Sub-title information from muxed formats such as
Matroska or MPEG consist of irregular buffers spaced far apart compared
navigational purposes, but to attach data to a point in time (envelopes,
loops, â€¦).

API wise there is some overlap between: - exposing multiple audio/video
tracks as pads or as ToC editions. For ToC editions, we have the
TocSelect event. - exposing subtitles as a sparse stream or as ToC
sequence of markers with labels
