##### Running the `gst-launch-1.0` command with Iot-certificate and different stream-names than the thing-name

**Note:** Supply a the matching iot-thing-name (that the certificate points to) and we can stream to multiple stream-names (without the stream-name needing to be the same as the thing-name) using the same certificate credentials. iot-thing-name and stream-name can be completely different as long as there is a policy that allows the thing to write to the kinesis stream

##### Running the GStreamer webcam sample application
The sample application `kvs_gstreamer_sample` in the `build` directory uses GStreamer pipeline to get video data from the camera. Launch it with a stream name and it will start streaming from the camera. The user can also supply a streaming resolution (width and height) through command line arguments.

```
Usage: AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=YourAccessKeyId AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=YourSecretAccessKey ./kvs_gstreamer_sample <my_stream_name> -w <width> -h <height> -f <framerate> -b <bitrateInKBPS>
```
* **A.** If **resolution is provided** then the sample will try to check if the camera supports that resolution. If it does detect that the camera can support the resolution supplied in command line, then streaming starts; else, it will fail with an error message `Resolution not supported`.
* **B.** If **no resolution is specified**, the sample application will try to use these three resolutions **640x480, 1280x720 and 1920x1080** and will **start streaming** once the camera supported resolution is detected.

##### Running the GStreamer RTSP sample application
`kvs_gstreamer_sample` supports sending video from a RTSP URL (IP camera). You can find the RTSP URL from your IP camera manual or manufacturers product page. Change your current working direcctory to `build` directory. Launch it with a stream name and `rtsp_url`  and it will start streaming.

##### Running the GStreamer sample application to upload a *audio and video* file

`kinesis_video_gstreamer_audio_video_sample_app` supports uploading a video that is either MKV, MPEGTS, or MP4. The sample application expects the video is encoded in H264 and audio is encoded in AAC format. Note: If your media uses a different format, then you can revise the pipeline elements in the sample application to suit your media format.

Change your current working directory to `build`. Launch the sample application with a stream name and a path to the file and it will start streaming.
