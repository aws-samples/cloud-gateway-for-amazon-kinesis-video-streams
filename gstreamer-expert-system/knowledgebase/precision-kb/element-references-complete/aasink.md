The examples below assume that you have the correct plug-ins available.
In general, "pulsesink" can be substituted with another audio output
plug-in such as "alsasink", "osxaudiosink", or "wasapisink"

Likewise, `xvimagesink` can be substituted with `d3dvideosink`,
`ximagesink`, `sdlvideosink`, `osxvideosink`, or `aasink`.

Keep in mind though that different sinks might accept different formats and
even the same sink might accept different formats on different machines, so
you might need to add converter elements like `audioconvert` and `audioresample`
for audio or `videoconvertscale` in front of the sink to make things work.

### Audio playback

**Note:** For audio/video playback it's best to use the `playbin3` or
`uridecodebin3` elements, these are just example pipelines.

Play the mp3 music file "music.mp3" using a libmpg123-based plug-in and
output it to an audio device via PulseAudio (or PipeWire).
