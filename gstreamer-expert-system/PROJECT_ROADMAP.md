## 🎯 Detailed Work Items

### **Immediate Priority (This Session)**

#### 1. Repository Cleanup
```bash
# Files to remove/consolidate:
- mcp-gstreamer-expert/enhanced_gstreamer_server.py (duplicate)
- mcp-gstreamer-expert/enhanced_multi_tool_server.py (partial)
- mcp-gstreamer-expert/enhanced_multi_tool_server_part2.py (partial)
- mcp-gstreamer-expert/enhanced_multi_tool_server_final.py (incomplete)
- current-config/ (old Bedrock agent files)
- temp-dev/ (development artifacts)
```

#### 2. README.md Rewrite
**New structure:**
- Project overview with current capabilities
- Quick start guide
- Multi-tool architecture explanation
- Q CLI integration instructions
- Advanced usage examples
- Development and testing framework

#### 3. System Specification Updates
**Add sections for:**
- Multi-tool architecture details
- Context-gathering capabilities
- KVS-specific requirements (placeholder)
- Distribution strategy considerations

### **KVS Enhancement Research**

#### KVS Feature Requirements Matrix
| Feature | Container | Codecs | Audio Tracks | Notes |
|---------|-----------|--------|--------------|-------|
| **HLS Playback** | Fragmented MP4 | H.264/H.265 | Single track | Requires proper fragmentation |
| **DASH Playbook** | Fragmented MP4 | H.264/H.265 | Single track | Similar to HLS requirements |
| **GetClip API** | Fragmented MP4 | H.264/H.265 | Single track | Requires proper timestamps |
| **Amazon Connect** | Any | Any | Multi-track OK | Different requirements |

#### Detection Logic
```python
def detect_kvs_feature_intent(user_query: str) -> List[str]:
    """Detect if user intends to use specific KVS features"""
    features = []
    
    if any(term in user_query.lower() for term in ['hls', 'dash', 'playback']):
        features.append('playback')
    if any(term in user_query.lower() for term in ['getclip', 'clip']):
        features.append('getclip')
    if any(term in user_query.lower() for term in ['connect', 'contact center']):
        features.append('connect')
    
    return features
```

### **Distribution Strategy Analysis**

#### Option 1: Local Installation (Recommended)
**Pros:**
- ✅ No hosting costs or infrastructure
- ✅ User data stays local (security)
- ✅ No authentication complexity
- ✅ Works offline after setup

**Cons:**
- ❌ User setup complexity (Python, venv, AWS CLI)
- ❌ Dependency management
- ❌ Updates require manual process

**Implementation:**
```bash
# One-command installer
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/user/repo/main/install.sh | bash
```

#### Option 2: Hosted Service
**Pros:**
- ✅ Zero user setup
- ✅ Centralized updates
- ✅ Consistent environment

**Cons:**
- ❌ AWS hosting costs (~$50-200/month)
- ❌ Authentication system needed
- ❌ Security considerations
- ❌ User data privacy concerns

#### Option 3: Hybrid (Future Consideration)
- Local MCP server
- Cloud-based knowledge base updates
- Optional cloud features (analytics, sharing)

**Total Estimated Time**: 20-31 sessions over 4-8 weeks

### **Investment Requirements**

#### **Hardware Investment (One-time)**
- **Physical Devices**: ~$1,400 (Raspberry Pi, Jetson, NUC, accessories)
- **Development Setup**: Existing macOS development environment
- **Network Infrastructure**: Minimal additional cost

#### **Cloud Infrastructure (Monthly)**
- **AWS Testing**: ~$120-170/month (EC2 instances, storage)
- **Cost Optimization**: Spot instances, scheduled testing
- **ROI Timeline**: 3-6 months through improved accuracy and user satisfaction
